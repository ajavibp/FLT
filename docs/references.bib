  abstract = {The price to be paid for the great dynamic richness of nonlinear systems
	is the lack of a unitary theory that allows control-system design
	to be tacked in a way that is parallel or analogous to that of linear
	systems. We propose a general methodology that uses fuzzy logic to
	systematically and formally synthesize nonlinear control systems,
	which are stable by design. Although this methodology is based on
	Lyapunov theory, it avoids searching for Lyapunov functions. This
	allows the synthesis procedure to be systematic as well as formal
	and, especially, independent of heuristics. Some examples of nonlinear
	control are solved in this paper, thus allowing assessment of the
	proposed methodology.},
